# hi i am silas

writing intros is too much pressure. 

I like working on projects. 

Here are some I'm proud of:

- Built a [[projects/ChatGPT iMessage Bot|ChatGPT-powered iMessage bot]] that auto-responds to texts when I'm in focus mode. It reads the macOS do-not-disturb state and uses message history to craft personalized responses.
- Made a [[projects/spawn killing craigslist free|Craigslist free section scraper]] that texts me the instant something gets posted. Being first to respond is everything.
- Created a [[projects/flowers + epoxy + rp2040|wedding gift]] by embedding flowers in epoxy with a rp2040 driving NeoPixels underneath.
- CAD'd a [[projects/grateful dead dancing bear marque|Grateful Dead dancing bear light marquee]] and lit it using arduino and NeoPixels.
- Created a desk display of [[projects/boids algo rp2040|boid's algorithm on an RP2040]]. Uses c protothreads + multicore.

... Amongst others that can be seen in the projects sub dir.
