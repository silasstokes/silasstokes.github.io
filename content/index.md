# hi i am silas

writing intros is too much pressure.

I like working on projects. 

Currently I am aspiring to be the pied piper of the modern desk. Removing the need for computer mice by creating a keyboard where the keycaps are trackpads. See more in [[trackie 1 - commitment to trackie]].

Here are some other projects I'm proud of:

- Built a [[projects/ChatGPT iMessage Bot|ChatGPT-powered iMessage bot]] that auto-responds to texts when I'm in focus mode. It reads the macOS do-not-disturb state and uses message history to craft personalized responses.
- Made a [[projects/spawn killing craigslist free|Craigslist free section scraper]] that texts me the instant something gets posted.
- Created a [[projects/flowers + epoxy + rp2040|wedding gift]] by embedding flowers in epoxy with a rp2040 driving NeoPixels underneath.
- CAD'd a [[projects/grateful dead dancing bear marque|Grateful Dead dancing bear light marquee]] and lit it using arduino and NeoPixels.
- Created a desk display of [[projects/boids algo rp2040|boid's algorithm on an RP2040]]. Uses protothreads.

... Amongst others that can be seen in the projects sub dir.
