Adapter to fit over the xilinx jlink adapter underside to prevent the exposed pins from shorting. I had tried to use FreeCAD once prior to having used Fusion360 and found it impossible. This time however, it was... still a learning curve... but easily surmountable with some youtube tutorials. One thing that I didn't appreciate initially but do now - FreeCAD really enforces designs to be built with constraints. I have pretty much never constrained in fusion beyond the automagical generated constraints given from clicking at the right place so it was a new workflow for me. I could feel my thought pattern shifting from a sketch being a series of discrete measurements I had take, to being a homogenous design where each line had a definable relationship to another.
